My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 88 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, ana I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occaasionally drink. I'm in abed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having aa glasas of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before agoing to bed, I usually have no proablems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wakea up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my lasat check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like waning and losing, that would caaause me to lose sleep aat night. That is how I deal with sociaety, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.
